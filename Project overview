🏥 Project Description
The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive desktop application built with Python's Tkinter library 
that streamlines patient management in a hospital environment. This system provides an intuitive graphical 
interface for healthcare administrators to efficiently manage patient records, assign doctors based on 
medical conditions, and visualize hospital statistics.

🎯 Key Features
1. Patient Management
Add New Patients: Register patients with complete details including ID, name, age, gender, and medical condition

Update Records: Modify existing patient information with real-time updates

Delete Patients: Remove patient records from the system

Auto-Doctor Assignment: Intelligent system that automatically assigns specialists based on patient symptoms

2. Smart Doctor Assignment
The system automatically assigns appropriate medical specialists using intelligent disease detection:

Cardiology: Heart-related conditions

Neurology: Brain and nerve disorders

Orthopedics: Bone fractures and injuries

Dermatology: Skin conditions and rashes

Pediatrics: Child illnesses and fevers

General Medicine: Default for unspecified conditions

3. Data Visualization
Department-wise Distribution: Bar chart showing patient load across different departments

Gender Distribution: Pie chart displaying gender demographics of patients

Real-time Analytics: Dynamic charts that update with new patient data

4. User Interface
Modern Design: Clean, professional interface with color-coded elements

Responsive Layout: Adaptable to different screen sizes

Interactive Table: Scrollable patient records with double-click selection

Form Validation: Input validation and error handling
